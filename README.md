# Breakthrough Listen REU 2024 GNU Radio materials

This repository contains the materials used for the GNU Radio tutorials
of the Breakthrough Listen Research Experience for Undergraduates 2024.

## Outline

* Session 1. [introduction-slides](introduction-slides). Introductory slides for
  the tutorials.

* Session 1. [rtlsdr](rtlsdr). Example showing how to receive signals with the
  RTL-SDR in GNU Radio.

* Session 1. [audio](audio). Example showing how to generate and display audio
  (soundcard) signals with GNU Radio.

* Session 2. [iq-sampling](iq-sample). Explanation about real sampling and IQ
  sampling in the context of how an SDR receiver such as the RTL-SDR works.
  
* Sessions 2 & 3. [fm-broadcast](fm-broadcast). FM broadcast receiver.

* Session 3. [spectral-analysis](spectral-analysis). Spectral analysis and
  generation of narrowband and wideband signals with a given CN0.
  
* Session 4. [turboseti](turboseti). Generation of data for analysis with
  turboSETI. Filterbank files and Doppler drift.

* Session 5. [scripting](scripting). Using Parameters and calling a GNU Radio
  flowgraph from the command line and from Python code.

* Session 5. [python-blocks](python-blocks). Example of usage of a Python Block:
  narroband RFI cancellation in the spectrum.
 
* Session 6. [beamforming](beamforming). Beamforming and interferometry.

* Session 7 (field trip to the Allen Telescope
  Array). [hydrogen-line](hydrogen-line). Hydrogen line observation.
